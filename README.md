# Hotel Data Analysis

## Description

The hotel project involves creating a database to analyze and visualize hotel booking data using SQL(SSMS). The objective is to build a visual data story or dashboard using Power BI to present to stakeholders. To achieve this, the following requirements were identified:

* Whether the hotel revenue is growing by year
* Analyzing trends in guests with personal cars to determine if the hotel needs to increase parking lot size
* Identify trends in the data with a focus on the average daily rate and guests to explore seasonality
